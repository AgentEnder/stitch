# GMS2 Project Automater

For the `yyp` level, the resource types are:

1. GMAudioGroup
2. GMTextureGroup
3. GMIncludedFile
4. GMFolder
5. GMProject

All the other resources are only logged in yyp, but further inferred in their own yy file.

1. Trailing commas
2. Preserve Int64
3. Paths no longer enforces the resource type

Color coding can be used to distinguish types or modules
