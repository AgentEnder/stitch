# GML Typings

GML has similar syntax and rules to JavaScript, but lacks an ecosystem of strong type support like that provided to JavaScript by Typescript.

This folder contains draft Typescript files for GML functions, constants, and resources, for use in creating tools related to GML. Examples include JavaScript âž¡ GML transpilers, language servers, and the like.

This draft is *very rough*, and was largely auto-generated via the work done by Yellow Afterlife for [GMEdit](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife/GMEdit).
