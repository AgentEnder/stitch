# TODO

+ Review config, gitignore, etc
+ What do "modules" mean with the changes to how Gamemaker stores assets (e.g. there is no longer a required root sprite folder etc)
  + Once we've decided that, update the sample-module-source to have sample module structure
+ Add a variety of assets (at least one per type, with folders of various nesting) to the sample-project
+ Start populating the Readme file with information about how GMS2.3 handles assets and file structures
