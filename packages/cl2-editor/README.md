## Features

### Story Editor

Crashlands 2 quests are organized by "Storyline". This extension reads the GameChanger data from Crashlands 2 and provides a tree view of the Storylines and their Quests.

The GameChanger data is highly structured JSON, described by JSON Schema-like structures. This extension creates a text-based view of Quest "motes" from the GameChanger, converting back and forth between the JSON and the text representation, to provide a good editing experience for narrative-focused content.
