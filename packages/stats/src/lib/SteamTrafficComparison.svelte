	<h3>Steam Traffic Comparison</h3>

	<p>
		The <a href={`https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/navtrafficstats/${steamId}`}>Steam Traffic</a>
		page provides download buttons to get the data as CSV, but doesn't provide a way to compare two periods.
		You can upload CSVs for two different periods here to compare them.
