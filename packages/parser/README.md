A basic parser for [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/) code.

## TODO

- Parse `global` property definitions

## Features

This is *not* a comprehensive parser. It includes features needed by the [Butterscotch Shenanigans](https://www.bscotch.net) team to address various development tasks.

- Collect names and locations of all identifiers
- Collect names and locations of all root-level function definitions
- Collect names and locations of all `#macro` definitions
