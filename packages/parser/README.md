# GameMaker Language (GML) Parser

A parser for [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/) code, focused on use cases of the Stitch for VSCode extension.

## TODO

- Color-coding of:
  - macros
  - globals
  - vars
  - assets (all one color)
- Asset browser
- Easy running
- Easy cache-cleaning

### DATA MODEL

The current goal of the parser is to generate a collection of data structures that include all of the identifiers we want to be able to use for navigation, autocomplete, and documentation while editing a GameMaker project.
