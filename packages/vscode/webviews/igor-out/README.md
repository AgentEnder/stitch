# Igor Out

This Svelte + Vite App creates a webview for displaying STDOUT/STDERR from GameMaker's Igor.exe when running it via Stitch VSCode.

## Setup Notes

- App created with `pnpm create vite@latest`
- Used JavaScript instead of Typescript to reduce config complexity, since this should be a relatively simple one-page app
